# Data-Analysis-for-B2B-Retail-Customer-Analytics-Report

This project is one of the project-based modules that I have completed at DQLab
Academy. Xyz.com is a B2B startup that sells various products not directly to end users
but to other businesses/companies. As a data-driven company, every decision-making
at xyz.com is always based on data. I'm doing a Customer Analytics Report using SQL.
